# Project Documentation: Legacy ERP Modernization Pipeline

## Overview

### Purpose of the Project

This project investigates how **code intelligence techniques** can improve the safety and confidence of legacy ERP modernization. Rather than migrating or rewriting code, the goal is to **make existing business-critical logic understandable, traceable, and verifiable** before any changes are attempted.

The focus is on **ERPNext**, specifically the **Sales Invoice** module, which contains dense accounting, stock, and validation logic that is difficult to reason about through documentation alone.

## Problem Statement & Approach

### Problem Statement

Legacy ERP systems often contain:

- Business logic spread across many files and hooks
- Implicit dependencies that are hard to trace
- High risk of regression when making changes

### Approach Taken

This project builds a **local-first, graph-augmented RAG pipeline** that:

1. Performs **Remote Repository Scanning** via GitHub APIs to avoid heavy local cloning.
2. Parses the codebase using **AST-aware logic** to extract symbols and call-relationships.
3. Employs **Hybrid Syntax-Aware Chunking** to preserve logical function boundaries.
4. Verifies retrieval quality using a **RetrievalEvaluator** and automated **LLM-as-a-Judge** scoring.

      "description": "Checks if the return invoice is linked with any payment entry where the allocated amount is negative, indicating a potential issue with payment allocation upon cancellation. If found and 'unlink_payment_on_cancellation_of_invoice' is enabled, it throws an error, prompting the user to cancel and amend the payment entry to unallocate the amount."

      "step": "on_cancel",
      "description": "Within the `on_cancel` method, if `update_stock` is enabled, the stock ledger is updated, stock reservation entries are updated, and future stock ledger entries and general ledger entries are reposted."

### High-Level Pipeline

1. **Remote Repository Scanning (`GitHubScanner`)**  
   The system performs a recursive scan of the ERPNext repository using the GitHub API to discover files and metadata without full local clones.

2. **AST-Based Parsing (`CodeGraphPipeline`)**  
   Code is parsed using **Tree-sitter** or regex-based AST logic to identify classes, methods, and variables, mapping them into a directed graph via **NetworkX**.

3. **Hybrid Chunking & Embedding**
   - **Chunking:** The `HybridChunker` ensures code blocks are split at logical boundaries (functions/classes) rather than arbitrary line counts.
   - **Embedding:** Chunks are embedded using **BGE-Large-v1.5** to generate 1024-dimensional semantic vectors.
   - **Storage:** Vectors and metadata are stored in **LanceDB**.

4. **GraphRAG Retrieval Strategy**  
   The `ModernizationChat` agent executes a dual-path search:
   - **Semantic Path:** LanceDB finds relevant code chunks.
   - **Structural Path:** NetworkX traverses the call-graph to find upstream/downstream dependencies.

5. **Automated Evaluation & Tracking**
   - **LLM-as-a-Judge:** An automated grader (Gemini) assesses responses for **Accuracy** and **Completeness** against a `golden_dataset.json`.
   - **MLflow Integration:** All metrics (Hit Rate @ 5, MRR, Accuracy scores) and artifacts (GEXF graphs, reports) are logged to an MLflow dashboard for experiment tracking.

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns across packages
- **Absolute Imports**: All internal imports use package paths (e.g., `from core.scanner import LocalScanner`)
- **Path Anchoring**: Database always created at project root via `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Professional package structure with proper `__init__.py` files

### Observed Execution Phases (Hypotheses)

- **Validation:** Deferred revenue checks, tax template validation, inter-company address validation
- **Accounting:** GL entry creation, perpetual inventory accounting, advance allocation
- **Stock:** Stock updates, serial/batch handling, reversals on cancellation
- **Hooks:** Post-submit and post-cancel side effects driven by system settings

These phases are **derived from code structure and call relationships**, not manually curated documentation.

## Verification & Metrics

To ensure the system is producing useful results, we track two primary dimensions of quality:

### 1. Retrieval Metrics

- **Hit Rate @ 5:** Validates that the core business logic files appear in the top 5 search results.
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):** Measures how effectively the system ranks the most relevant file.

### 2. Generation Metrics (LLM-as-a-Judge)

The system achieves an **Accuracy Delta of +2.5** over baseline RAG by incorporating structural graph context. Every run is graded on:

- **Accuracy:** Correct identification of ERPNext functions and triggers.
- **Completeness:** Coverage of the full business workflow (Validation → Accounting → Stock).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that **graph-augmented retrieval** can make complex ERP codebases more understandable and measurable. By incorporating **automated evaluation** and **MLflow tracking**, it provides a verifiable foundation for safer legacy modernization.
